# GitHub-Profile-Picture-Generator-with-Image-Thresholding
Create a GitHub profile picture using Python's OpenCV package. 
The project utilizes various image processing methods: 
1) Conversion to black-and-white; 
2) Global thresholding; 
3) Adaptive Mean Thresholding; 
4) Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding. 

The final profile picture uses the Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding.
